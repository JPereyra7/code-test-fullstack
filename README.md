# Full Stack React + Express

See [INSTRUCTIONS.md](INSTRUCTIONS.md) for implementation instructions.

## Running Express + PostgreSQL

This application is running a NodeJS Express application, with a built-in connection to a PostgreSQL database. We've also installed Sequelize, which is a promise-based ORM tool to make it easy to interact with the database. Changes are automatically applied as you type them, and you can add as many files to the project as you need.
